# NodeRed_WeatherBulbs
Using Tuya Based lightbulbs to display the weather.


This works with NodeRed and Home Assistant to control RGBWW Tuya based bulbs that have been flashed to ESPHome.  

Outside of the inbuilt nodes I used the used nodes node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket, node-red-contrib-bigtimer, node-red-node-openweathermap

This is placed for use by others who may be interested and want to try it.  It comes with no support or guarantee.
